Ariele,

- Congratulations on passing the judge Kattis!


However, 

- You are using tabs! You must use two-space indentation.

- The program is missing the header specified in the style guidelines:
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

- Line #4 is incorrectly indented.

- The comment in line #4 does not add anything constructive about the function
  of the program. It should be more descriptive or removed. 

- Comments usually preceed the statements that they describe; however, your
  comment appears after the statements, which is incorrect. 

- Please read the style guidelines to make sure you understand them. Do not
  hesitate to ask any questions.


Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
