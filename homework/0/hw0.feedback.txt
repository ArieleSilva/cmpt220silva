Ariele,

- Good job in creating your accounts!

- Good job in setting up your java compiler in your system.

- Good job with your first GitHub submission!


However,

- The link to your GitHub repository was nowhere to be found in your document
  or screenshots. 

- Although the assignment is in the specified folder, the repository in general
  is not properly organized and is confusing.

- Please organize your GitHub repository immediately.

- A little header or cover page with your name, class, assignment, date, etc.
  is always good to have in any assignment of this type.


Peace,

- Dr. Pablo Rivas
